# Obligation Tracker for Star Wars: Edge of the Empire roleplaying game

## Overview

After starting a new Star Wars roleplaying campaign, my game master (GM) asked if I could develop a tool to help track obligation more easily.  Each character has 1 or more obligations which are assigned a specific value.  The GM is supposed to keep track of the obligations of each character on a chart, with each obligation being assigned a range of the overall party obligation.  For example, if character A has a single obligation with a value of 15, and character B has a single obligation with a value of 10, the party obligation chart would have character A at the range 1-15, character B at the range 16-25, etc.  Each session the GM rolls a D% (two ten-sided dice, one representing tens place, use to generate a percent value from 1-100).  If the result falls within the range of a specific obligation, that obligation should come up narratively in play, and the character reduces their strain threshold to represent the stress of the obligation coming into play.

Obligation values can be brought down in play, but they may also increase during play through the result of narrative actions by the player(s).  Entirely new obligations may also be generated during play.  Some groups engage with the obligation mechanic and adjust values more than others.  Needless to say, for groups where obligation changes frequently, keeping track of individual ranges on paper can be a headache.  

This obligation tracker is designed to automate most of the book keeping.  Clicking on a character's name opens their individual obligation menu.  Obligations can be assigned, deleted, or the values of existing obligations can be adjusted.  All adjustments will automatically update the obligation chart.

## Note on Styling

I wanted to get this app working quickly, so that it would be ready before my next game session.  The UI styling was not my top priority.  I'm not particularly happy with it, but the app is functional which is good enough for now.  I may go back and update the UI in the future.
